## Branch Strategy

### `master` - Production Branch
- Stable, tested versions
- Contains working QOL framework with all features
- Current Status: **Complete enhanced QOL framework with nominal dollar reporting**

### `development` - Integration Branch  
- Active development and testing
- Feature integration before merging to master
- Use for experimental enhancements

### `feature/advanced-scenarios` - Feature Branch
- Advanced scenario development
- Market condition variations
- Extreme stress testing scenarios

## Current Version Status

**Initial Commit (701fa6d)**
- ✅ Enhanced QOL Framework with customizable withdrawal rates
- ✅ Monte Carlo simulation with 1,000+ paths
- ✅ Depletion risk analysis and survival rate modeling
- ✅ Professional PDF report generation (ReportLab)
- ✅ Standardized scenarios ($1M portfolio, retire at 70, 35-year horizon)
- ✅ Nominal dollar reporting throughout
- ✅ Variable QOL formula testing (4.8% to 9.0% early withdrawals)
- ✅ Comprehensive stress testing with volatility up to 25%

## Key Research Results Preserved

### QOL Strategy Analysis
- **Traditional 4% Rule**: $40,000/year → $3,202,115 final (0% depletion)
- **QOL Standard (5.4%/4.5%/3.5%)**: $54,000/year → $2,582,955 final (0% depletion)  
- **QOL Maximum (9%/7%/5%)**: $90,000/year → $1,132,722 final (0% depletion)

### Framework Robustness
- Zero depletion risk even at extreme 9% early withdrawal rates
- Validates thesis: significant room for higher quality-of-life spending
- Monte Carlo validation with realistic market volatility (15-25%)

## Workflow

1. **Make changes**: Edit files as needed
2. **Stage changes**: `git add .`
3. **Commit changes**: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
4. **Switch branches**: `git checkout [branch-name]`
5. **View history**: `git log --oneline`
6. **Check status**: `git status`

## Backup Strategy

- Local Git repository provides version history
- All research results and analysis preserved in commit history
- Generated reports and data files tracked but can be regenerated
- Privacy-first .gitignore protects sensitive data

## Next Steps

- Use `development` branch for framework enhancements
- Use `feature/advanced-scenarios` for new scenario development  
- Merge stable features back to `master`
- Consider remote backup repository for additional protection
