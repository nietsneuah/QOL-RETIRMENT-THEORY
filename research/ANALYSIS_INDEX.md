## üîç Key Findings Summary

### Breakthrough Result
**Aggressive Glide Path strategy achieves $0.97 per enjoyment dollar** - the first QOL strategy to achieve sub-$1.00 efficiency.

### Optimal Strategy: Aggressive Glide Path
- **Phase 1 (Ages 65-74)**: 100% stocks, 1.35x QOL enhancement
- **Phase 2 (Ages 75-84)**: 70% stocks, 1.125x QOL enhancement  
- **Phase 3 (Ages 85+)**: 40% stocks, 0.875x QOL enhancement

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Benefit**: 10.8% higher enjoyment value
- **Cost**: 7.1% lower success rate (45.8% vs 52.9%)
- **Net result**: Excellent value at $0.97 per enjoyment dollar

### Distribution Insights
- **When successful**: 17-28% higher wealth than Trinity Study
- **Bimodal outcomes**: Clear success vs struggle patterns
- **Decision rationale**: Perfect alignment of risk level with enjoyment value

## üéØ Implementation Guide

### Decision Framework
**Choose Aggressive Glide Path if:**
- Value early retirement enjoyment highly
- Comfortable with moderate additional risk
- Have backup income sources or safety nets
- Want to maximize enjoyment-adjusted retirement value

### Key Decision Points
1. **Year 10 (Age 75)**: Reduce from 100% to 70% stocks
2. **Year 20 (Age 85)**: Reduce from 70% to 40% stocks

### Success Factors
- Disciplined reallocation at predetermined points
- Understanding of trade-off structure
- Appropriate risk management and backup planning
