================================================================================

üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
Analysis of 10,000 simulations examining portfolio value distributions
at key decision points (Years 10 and 20) for the Aggressive Glide Path
strategy compared to the Trinity Study baseline.

üìà KEY FINDINGS
------------------------------

üéÇ YEAR 10 (AGE 75) - FIRST REALLOCATION DECISION
   Decision Context: Reduce allocation from 100% to 70% stocks

   ALL SCENARIOS:
   ‚Ä¢ Aggressive Glide median: $913,768
   ‚Ä¢ Trinity Study median: $977,419
   ‚Ä¢ Advantage: -6.5% (Trinity leads by $63,651)

   SUCCESSFUL SCENARIOS ONLY:
   ‚Ä¢ Aggressive Glide median: $1,614,119
   ‚Ä¢ Trinity Study median: $1,372,836
   ‚Ä¢ Advantage: +17.6% (Aggressive leads by $241,283)

   üí° INSIGHT: When Aggressive Glide succeeds, it builds substantial
       wealth advantage by Year 10 through aggressive early allocation.

üéÇ YEAR 20 (AGE 85) - SECOND REALLOCATION DECISION
   Decision Context: Reduce allocation from 70% to 40% stocks

   ALL SCENARIOS:
   ‚Ä¢ Aggressive Glide median: $427,461
   ‚Ä¢ Trinity Study median: $989,143
   ‚Ä¢ Advantage: -56.8% (Trinity leads by $561,682)

   SUCCESSFUL SCENARIOS ONLY:
   ‚Ä¢ Aggressive Glide median: $1,830,808
   ‚Ä¢ Trinity Study median: $1,541,151
   ‚Ä¢ Advantage: +18.8% (Aggressive leads by $289,656)

   üí° INSIGHT: Higher QOL withdrawals reduce overall portfolio values,
       but successful scenarios maintain strong wealth advantage.

üèÅ FINAL OUTCOME (AGE 94)

   SUCCESS RATES:
   ‚Ä¢ Aggressive Glide Path: 45.8%
   ‚Ä¢ Trinity Study: 52.9%
   ‚Ä¢ Success rate penalty: -7.1%

   SUCCESSFUL SCENARIOS FINAL VALUES:
   ‚Ä¢ Aggressive Glide median: $1,793,258
   ‚Ä¢ Trinity Study median: $1,397,318
   ‚Ä¢ Advantage: +28.3% (Aggressive leads by $395,940)

üéâ ENJOYMENT VALUE ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
   Total Enjoyment Value (Successful Scenarios):
   ‚Ä¢ Aggressive Glide Path: $2,469,991
   ‚Ä¢ Trinity Study equivalent: $2,229,563
   ‚Ä¢ Enjoyment advantage: +10.8%

üîç STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS
----------------------------------------

1. TRADE-OFF STRUCTURE:
   ‚Ä¢ Lower success rate (-7.1%) for higher enjoyment (+10.8%)
   ‚Ä¢ Cost per enjoyment dollar: $0.97 (excellent value)

2. DECISION POINT RATIONALE:
   ‚Ä¢ Year 10: Reduce risk as early wealth-building phase ends
   ‚Ä¢ Year 20: Prioritize preservation as enjoyment value drops

3. SUCCESS PROFILE:
   ‚Ä¢ When successful, provides 17-28% higher final wealth
   ‚Ä¢ Builds substantial early advantage through aggressive allocation
   ‚Ä¢ Higher variability creates both bigger wins and losses

üìä DISTRIBUTION CHARACTERISTICS
----------------------------------------

YEAR 10 PATTERNS:
‚Ä¢ Aggressive Glide: Higher volatility, wider distribution
‚Ä¢ Trinity Study: More consistent outcomes, lower variance
‚Ä¢ Failure rate impact: 4.6% vs 0.2% at Year 10

YEAR 20 PATTERNS:
‚Ä¢ Aggressive Glide: Bimodal distribution (success vs struggle)
‚Ä¢ Trinity Study: More normal distribution shape
‚Ä¢ Failure rate impact: 35.1% vs 19.1% at Year 20

üí° DECISION FRAMEWORK
------------------------------

CHOOSE AGGRESSIVE GLIDE PATH IF:
‚Ä¢ Value early retirement enjoyment highly
‚Ä¢ Comfortable with 7% higher failure risk
‚Ä¢ Willing to accept higher portfolio volatility
‚Ä¢ Believe in long-term equity market performance

CHOOSE TRINITY STUDY IF:
‚Ä¢ Prioritize portfolio survival certainty
‚Ä¢ Prefer consistent, predictable outcomes
‚Ä¢ Risk-averse personality
‚Ä¢ Value capital preservation over enjoyment premium

üéØ OPTIMAL USE CASE
------------------------------
The Aggressive Glide Path is optimal for retirees who:
1. Have additional income sources or safety nets
2. Place high value on early retirement experiences
3. Are comfortable with dynamic allocation decisions
4. Want to maximize enjoyment-adjusted retirement value

At $0.97 per enjoyment dollar, it represents the most cost-effective
QOL strategy identified, making it worthwhile for those who value
enhanced early retirement experiences.
