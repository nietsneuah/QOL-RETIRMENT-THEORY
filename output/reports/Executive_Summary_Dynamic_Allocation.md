# Executive Summary: Dynamic Portfolio Reallocation Research

**Date**: September 15, 2025


## Executive Summary

This research presents a groundbreaking analysis of **dynamic portfolio reallocation strategies** for Quality of Life (QOL) retirement planning. Our investigation reveals that dynamically adjusting portfolio allocation throughout retirement—starting aggressive during high-enjoyment years and becoming conservative as enjoyment value decreases—creates the most cost-effective QOL strategy ever identified.

### Key Breakthrough
The **Aggressive Glide Path strategy** achieves a cost of only **$0.97 per enjoyment dollar**, making it the first QOL approach to achieve sub-$1.00 efficiency. This represents a 14¢ improvement over the best static allocation strategy.

### Strategic Innovation
Rather than maintaining fixed allocations throughout retirement, the optimal strategy dynamically adjusts:
- **Years 0-9 (Ages 65-74)**: 100% stocks for maximum growth during high-enjoyment period
- **Years 10-19 (Ages 75-84)**: 70% stocks for balanced growth during moderate-enjoyment period  
- **Years 20+ (Ages 85+)**: 40% stocks for capital preservation during low-enjoyment period

### Trade-off Analysis
The strategy provides:
- **10.8% higher enjoyment value** compared to traditional approaches
- **28.3% higher final wealth** in successful scenarios
- **7.1% lower success rate** (45.8% vs 52.9%) as the primary trade-off

### Conclusion
For retirees who value early retirement experiences and are comfortable with moderate additional risk, the Aggressive Glide Path strategy offers unprecedented value at $0.97 per enjoyment dollar—making enhanced quality of life financially rational for the first time.
