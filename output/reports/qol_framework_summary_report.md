# QOL Framework Analysis Report - Corrected Implementation
**Generated on September 14, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This analysis compares the corrected Quality of Life (QOL) retirement withdrawal framework against the traditional Trinity Study 4% rule. The QOL framework has been corrected to use Trinity Study as its foundation, applying QOL multipliers to redistribute withdrawals across retirement phases.

## Key Findings

### Strategy Performance Summary (Real Year 1 Dollars)

| Strategy | Total Real Income | Final Portfolio Value | Depletion Rate | Success Rate |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Trinity Study (4% Rule) | $829,120 | $68,472 | 84.6% | 11.6% |
| QOL Standard Strategy | $885,562 | $41,028 | 90.0% | 7.2% |
| QOL Enhanced Strategy | $943,895 | $14,630 | 96.9% | 2.7% |

### Corrected Implementation Details

**Trinity Study Foundation**: All QOL strategies now correctly use Trinity Study's 4% of initial portfolio (inflation-adjusted) as the base withdrawal amount.

**QOL Multipliers**: 
- **QOL Standard**: 135%/112.5%/87.5% of Trinity withdrawals across three phases
- **QOL Enhanced**: 175%/137.5%/100% of Trinity withdrawals across three phases

**Phase Definitions**:
- Phase 1 (Ages 70-79): Peak enjoyment years - higher withdrawals
- Phase 2 (Ages 80-89): Comfortable years - moderate withdrawals  
- Phase 3 (Ages 90-99): Care years - lower withdrawals

### Risk-Return Analysis

The corrected analysis reveals the true trade-offs:

1. **Higher Income, Higher Risk**: QOL strategies provide more total lifetime income but with significantly higher portfolio depletion rates
2. **Front-Loading Trade-off**: Early retirement years receive higher withdrawals at the cost of portfolio longevity
3. **Trinity Study Conservatism**: The traditional 4% rule shows its conservative nature with better portfolio preservation

### Methodology Corrections Applied

1. **Trinity Study Inflation Fix**: Corrected inflation timing so Year 1 withdrawal is exactly $40,000 real
2. **QOL Framework Rebase**: Changed from percentage-of-current-balance to Trinity-Study-with-multipliers approach
3. **Consistent Comparison**: Both strategies now use identical inflation-adjusted foundation for meaningful comparison

### Investment Assumptions

- **Starting Portfolio**: $1,000,000
- **Real Returns**: 1.5% annually (conservative assumption)
- **Inflation**: 3.0% annually with variability
- **Return Volatility**: 15% (realistic market conditions)
- **Simulation Count**: 1,000 Monte Carlo paths
- **Time Horizon**: 29 years (ages 70-99)

### Implications for Retirement Planning

The corrected QOL framework represents a **risk preference trade-off** rather than a superior strategy:

- **Choose QOL** if you prioritize early retirement enjoyment and are comfortable with higher depletion risk
- **Choose Trinity Study** if you prioritize portfolio preservation and steady, predictable withdrawals

Both strategies are now mathematically sound and provide meaningful comparison for retirement planning decisions.
