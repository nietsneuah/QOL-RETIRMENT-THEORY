ðŸ’° NORMALIZED ENJOYMENT VALUE ANALYSIS REPORT
================================================================================

ðŸ“‹ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
This analysis assigns dollar values to the 'enjoyment premium' of
early retirement years and normalizes all comparisons to Year 1
purchasing power for direct financial comparison.

ðŸŽ¯ ENJOYMENT VALUE ASSUMPTIONS
----------------------------------------
Income received during different life phases has different value:

â€¢ Low Enjoyment (Ages 85+): 1.0x value (baseline)

Question: Would you pay $1,500 to receive income in your first

ðŸ¤” PERSONAL DECISION FACTORS
----------------------------------------
The key question: How much extra would you personally pay to
receive retirement income during your healthy, active years
versus your later, potentially less active years?

If your personal enjoyment values are:
â€¢ Conservative (1.25x/1.1x/1.0x): QOL may not be worth it
â€¢ Moderate (1.5x/1.2x/1.0x): QOL is a reasonable choice
â€¢ Aggressive (2.0x/1.4x/1.0x): QOL is strongly recommended
